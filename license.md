So, long story short, for the time being, this code is best described as
"source viewable, you have very few appreciable rights, contributions are
considered to be given as a gift with no expectation beyond credit in
the project's history right now".

Longer term - purely speculatively, with no promises - the plan is to move
towards something more like a dual license thing where individuals can have
the whole shebang for self-hosting or whatever and OSS can utilize this
but commercial entities must pay license fees.

The exact details haven't been worked out, and frankly don't need worked
out any time soon. The project came about because *I* have a use for it,
and people who come to my home and people who stay in my home have a use
for it - not because I've set out to monetize it necessarily.

The source is viewable so that people can see it when we get stuck or
if they want to think about what we've done and how to rearrange it. As
a matter of conveinience, basically.

Likewise, I don't care to exclude monetization from my future. So it
seems that restricting until the question is actually necessary to
consider and fixing the license later is the solution. Move the problem
to a later date instead of losing sleep right now.

Always fun to write these novels.
